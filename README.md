After seeing what was working well and what wasn't with CNNs and RNNs alone,
this branch was revisited, to simplify the CNN, and play around with more
training parameters. This still didn't achieve much accuracy, and prompted a
sanity check where we removed the RNN layers

The relevant code for these efforts and python notebook are under the src folder

To include the dataset (which is private!!!) create a soft link
in this repository called "project_datasets"
(as in "ln -s <path to your project_datasets> project_datasets")
