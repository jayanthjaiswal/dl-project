# dl-project
After testing a few RNN atop CNN models, and seeing how
far we could get, we ran a few tests using the best CNN
setup for these combined models but removing the RNN layers.
It turned out, that the RNN layers were making our accuracy
worse.

the code and python notebook for this is under the "src" folder

To include the dataset (which is private!!!) create a soft link
in this repository called "project_datasets"
(as in "ln -s <path to your project_datasets> project_datasets")
