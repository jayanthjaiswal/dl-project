# dl-project
We implemented the deep (Large_CNN) from the paper (reference [1] in our report)
(There's also an implementation of one of our other shallow CNNs)
with many parameters in the init function, and created a function for training,
so that we could run a grid-search on different training parameters to probe around.

the relevant code for this section is under the "cnn" folder.

To include the dataset (which is private!!!) create a soft link
in this repository called "project_datasets"
(as in "ln -s <path to your project_datasets> project_datasets")
