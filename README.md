# dl-project
The three of us each explored a different direction,
this branch was the original exploration of the RNNs
on top of CNN layers. The relevant code and python notebook
for this section is under the folder called "src"

To include the dataset (which is private!!!) create a soft link
in this repository called "project_datasets"
(as in "ln -s <path to your project_datasets> project_datasets")
